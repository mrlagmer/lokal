# Cancelation Policy

We’d like to have the most amicable cancelation policy which takes into account both travelers and guides.

We understand that last minute cancelations are disruptive to our guides’ schedules. That being said, travelers may be making adjustments to their plans. We’ve created the following rules to have a standardised policy.

Once a traveler has booked they will be allotted 24 hours to cancel their booking. Given a traveler requests a cancelation in this 24 hour period, then they will receive a full refund.

After the 24 hour period has expired, a traveler cannot cancel their booking, but they can request a new time from their guide. Guides may accept new time-slots given their availability.

Once a traveler has booked an experience the guide will be sent a confirmation email. From this point, guides will also only have a 24 hour period to cancel the booking. Guides also have the option to request an alternative time after this point. Cancelations after this point may lead to penalties on the Lokally platform.

### Cancellations - how to avoid them

**Guides:** Review your booking schedule. We’ve found that cancelations may happen for guides because of inaccurate information on their availability.

**Travelers:** Double check your itinerary! Make sure you haven’t double booked and you have adequate time to make your tour.

**Communicate quickly:** If you have to cancel then be sure to send a message across to the other party as soon as possible.

**Last minute cancelations:** Last minute cancelations can happen for a number of reasons. Be sure to plan your day ahead to ensure that you can be at the meeting point on time.
We’ve found that traffic is a major disruption. Be sure to account for traffic through the day! Lastly, remember to *communicate* - communication is vital to ensuring that all parties are on the same page on the day of a tour!
