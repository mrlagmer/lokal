### Code of Conduct for Lokally Hosts

Lokally Guides are required to adhere to the Code of Conduct while using the platform and during the offering of a tour. Breach of this code will result in a review, conducted by our team, and may lead to suspension or permanent removal from the Lokally platform.

1. **Communicate with your guests and with Lokally.** Given there are updates or changes that must be made at any point leading to or during the tour, be reachable so that this can be communicated.
2. **Ensure that your travelers are safe.** Mitigate risk as much as possible during your tours. Inform your travelers of proper safety procedures if and when necessary.
3. **Discrimination of any sort will not be permitted.** Any discrimination based on race, gender, culture, nationality, sexual orientation, etc., will be reviewed and penalties on the Lokally platform may follow.
4. **Have an emergency contact ready in case of an emergency situation.**  Along with this, we recommend saving the contact information of the nearest medical facility and local authorities.
5. **Only travelers confirmed may be permitted to join private tours.** No other travelers should be included in private booked tours.
6. **Issues or complaints with Lokally should not be discussed with travelers.** Any issues with the Platform should be sent directly to Lokally.
7. **No part of the tour should be used for personal tasks.** For example, if you are on a food tour and part of the tour entails going to the market with your Travelers, this time should not be used to buy your weekly groceries.
8. **Adhere to the local alcohol and smoking policies.** We do not recommend smoking or drinking alcohol excessively during a tour. If you wish to smoke during a tour, please first ask your guests if they have any aversion to smoking. If your tour includes drinking, we request that alcohol consumption is kept to a respectable level. All guides must remain fully coherent through the full duration of their tour. Purchase of cigarettes or alcohol for minors is strictly prohibited.
9. **Do not litter during your tour** - we recommend providing means to dispose of rubbish properly.
10. **Possession of illegal drugs will not be permitted.** Breach of this policy will lead to review and possible removal from the Lokally platform.
11. **Do not solicit tips & service charges or request additional fees during a tour.** Along with this, discussion of remuneration is prohibited.
12. **Emotional involvement with any guest is forbidden.** Be aware that as a guide you are in a position of trust, and you are expected to act professionally at all times. Note that any sort of sexual misconduct with a minor is a criminal offense.
13. **We ask that all Guides dress appropriately for their tour.** Guides should not dress provocatively or expose themselves at any point during their tour.
14. **Day-of-tour cancellation is not acceptable unless done for a valid reason.** As stated previously, communication should be made with your Traveler and with Lokally if there are any updates.
