# Why experiences?

## Why do we focus on experiences?

I’ve lived in Manila for two years now and have found that finding activities here can be quite a challenge. Before I landed, I had a look at all the things to do. It seemed like there were quite a few places to go, but questions still loomed over my head.

- There are some beautiful beaches along the coast, but how would I get there? Could anyone take me? Where would I stay? What would I do once I got there?

- There’s a very trendy bar scene popping up in Manila, but where were these bars? Some of these are speakeasy’s - can I even get in? Once again, how do I get there?

- There are cultural tours, but some of these contacts are unavailable. Are the tours still happening? How do I get a hold of these tour guides?

This list goes on, and the more and more I searched - the more daunting it became. I figured I’d just be stuck in my apartment alone for the days to come.

## Through the grapevine

Time went on and I was able to learn about the area. I found new things to do, places to go, and events that were happening. As I thought more about it, I realised that these experiences were all coming through word of mouth. I’d hear about a place through a friend… who heard about it from an acquaintance… who heard about it from another colleague.

Other travelers started coming through the Philippines, and they’d shoot me messages, “Hey! What’s there to do in Manila?”

I was sending over recommendations left and right. That’s when I realised - this chain needs to be broken. There are so many unique experiences here in Manila, and there should be a place where someone can find them all.

## Lokally is born

With the help of a close friend, Lokally came to fruition. We realised we weren’t the only two that had problems finding things to do when exploring new places.

We’re now gathering guides to help travelers and adventure seekers find unique experiences, tours, and events. Doing something new, something unknown, something out of your comfort zone - it can be daunting. We want to take the pressure off of travelers by matching you with curated and trusted guides! We also want our guides to turn their hobby - their passion - into a fun learning experience for others.
