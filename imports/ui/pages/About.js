## Dive into the lokal culture.

We're getting lokal guides together with anyone who wants to find a new experience. This is a calling to those who love to explore and seek adventure. Find out what’s happening through Lokally.

## Our Mission

### Connect people with people

Our mission is simple - we want to connect people with each other so that they may learn, grow, and most importantly, understand what another culture is all about. We’re doing more than connecting guides with travelers, we’re building a community that understands the importance of sharing their backgrounds.

In order to connect people, their stories have to be heard. The world has made it easier for people to communicate online, but connecting to a new community can be scary… even a bit intimidating. That’s why we’ve created Lokally. We want people to be able to find a culture and community they’re interested in and immerse themselves in it. We want you to be able to hear the others’ stories, and also tell your own.

## Lokally Values

### Be adventurous
We’re of the firm belief that getting out there and trying something new is crucial to growth. We want people to step on a path they haven’t before and get out there. We’ll be doing the same.

### Better yourself and others
A community is only able to grow through the contribution of everyone in it. While people work to better themselves, continuously working to better those around them is vital to building a better world.

### Practice empathy
Every culture is different, and every individual has been brought through different experiences. Understanding that another person’s culture holds its own truths - which may or may not align with your own cultural ‘norms’ - helps us learn without bias.


### Become a storyteller
There’s a belief in some native cultures that the storyteller is the most important person of the group. The storyteller can pass along the tales of the past which shapes the narrative of the future. We’re continuously telling our stories, and we hope to understand more about others’ through their stories.

## Our Story

### Why do we focus on experiences?

Our founder, Parnell, lived in Manila for two years and had found that finding activities could be quite a challenge. Before he landed, he had a look at all the things to do. It seemed like there were quite a few places to go, but questions still loomed in his head.

- There are some beautiful beaches along the coast, but how would I get there? Could anyone take me? Where would I stay? What would I do once I got there?

- There’s a very trendy bar scene popping up in Manila, but where were these bars? Some of these are speakeasy’s - can I even get in? Once again, how do I get there?

- There are cultural tours, but some of these contacts are unavailable. Are the tours still happening? How do I get a hold of these tour guides?

This list goes on, and the more and more he searched - the more daunting it became. It seemed that being stuck in the apartment was all there was to look forward to.

### Through the grapevine

Time went on and Parnell was able to learn about the area. There were things to do, places to go, and events that were happening. As he thought more about it, he realised that these experiences were all coming through word of mouth. He’d hear about a place through a friend… who heard about it from an acquaintance… who heard about it from another colleague.

Other travelers started coming through the Philippines, and they’d shoot messages accross, “Hey! What’s there to do in Manila?”

Parnell was sending over recommendations left and right. That’s when he realised - this chain needed to be broken. There are so many unique experiences in Manila, and there should be a place where someone can find them all.

### Lokally is born

With the help of a close friend, Stu, Lokally came to fruition. Parnell and Stu realised they weren’t the only two that had problems finding things to do when exploring new places.

They’re now gathering guides to help travelers and adventure seekers find unique experiences, tours, and events.

Doing something new, something unknown, something out of your comfort zone - it can be daunting. Lokally wants to take the pressure off of travelers by matching them with curated and trusted guides! They also want their guides to turn their hobby - their passion - into a fun learning experience for others.
